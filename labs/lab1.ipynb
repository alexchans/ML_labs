    "1. **Overview of the Dataset and Its Purpose**  \n",
    "   The **Education Inequality Data** dataset ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shamimhasan8/education-inequality-data)) provides information on about 1,000 schools in the United States. It includes data such as **average test scores, funding per student, student–teacher ratio, and other school-level indicators**. The purpose of collecting this kind of data is to highlight patterns of inequality in the education system and to provide a basis for studying how different factors affect student performance. By bringing together financial, structural, and outcome-related information, the dataset allows us to explore whether students in underfunded or overcrowded schools are at a disadvantage compared to those in better-resourced schools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prediction Task**  \n",
    "   For our project, the **prediction task** is centered on the **average test score**. Instead of treating it as a continuous number, we will convert it into a **binary classification problem**: a school “passes” if its average test score is **≥ 70 (coded as 1)** and “fails” if the average is **below 70 (coded as 0)**. This framing allows us to study the conditions that increase the likelihood of passing or failing. While funding per student is an important feature, it is **not the only one that matters**. Other variables such as student–teacher ratio, overall enrollment, or demographic factors may also play a role in determining whether a school performs well. By including multiple features, we can better understand how resources and other conditions collectively influence student success.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why This Matters and Performance Expectations**  \n",
    "   The results of this prediction task would be useful for **educators, school administrators, policymakers, and nonprofits**. These groups care about identifying schools that are likely to struggle so they can allocate resources, design interventions, and advocate for more equitable policies. A model that can predict pass/fail outcomes with reasonably **high accuracy** would provide valuable insights, even if it is not perfect. For example, being able to correctly classify most schools would still help highlight patterns of inequality and guide decision-making. Importantly, since funding is not the sole determinant of student performance, the model could also reveal how other school characteristics contribute to success or failure, offering a more balanced and realistic understanding of the factors behind educational outcomes.  \n"
